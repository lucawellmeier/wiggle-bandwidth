\title{Wiggling the bandwidth in kernel ridgeless regression 
    with scale-dependent kernels}
\author{Luca Wellmeier}
\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
    We explore the possibility of using two different bandwidths in the 
    fitting and evaluation part in kernel ridgeless regression.
    The provided experimental results indicate that \textit{wiggling}
    the bandwidth in this way can generalize and be a cheap alternative to
    the classical Tikhonov square-norm penality.
    Finally, we propose and test a new iterative method for optimizing the 
    bandwidth parameter by employing wiggling in a local search.
